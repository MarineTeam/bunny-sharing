# Features

A detailed look at what this app does. For setup, see [README.md](./README.md).

## Sharing

### Single share
Pick one video, enter a recipient email and an expiry window (default 72
hours), and the app creates a unique link (`/watch/<token>`) and emails it
to them. The link is independently revocable and never shared with anyone
else.

### Bulk share
Select multiple videos and share them to multiple recipients (comma,
semicolon, or whitespace-separated) in one action. Every recipient × video
pair gets its own distinct link — an M-recipient, N-video bulk share creates
M×N independent links, not M×N copies of the same one. Each recipient
receives a single email listing only their own links, never anyone else's.

### One bundle per recipient
Sharing something new to an email address that already has an active share
— whether via a single share or a bulk share, in either order, at any later
time — doesn't create a new, separate notification. It folds into that
recipient's existing **bundle**: the new link is added to their bundle page,
and the notification email is rebuilt to list everything currently active
for them, not just what's new. A recipient's first-ever share still gets a
plain, simple email; every share after that consolidates.

### Bundle listing page
Once a recipient has more than one active share, they also get a bundle
page (`/bundle/<id>`) — one link listing everything shared with them.
Verifying their email once unlocks the *entire* bundle: every video in it
becomes playable immediately, without a second email round-trip per video.
Each video still independently enforces its own revoke/expiry status on
every page load, regardless of the bundle unlock — revoking one video is
reflected instantly on the bundle page too, without touching the bundle
record itself.

A bundle has no revoked flag of its own — it retires when `/api/cleanup`
runs and either its own expiry has passed, or every member it lists has
gone dead (revoked, expired, or deleted). The second condition matters
because a bundle's own expiry only ever grows (it tracks the latest of
every member ever added, via Extend), so without it, revoking or
permanently deleting every video in a bundle would leave a fully
live, gate-able bundle page behind with nothing left to show.

Every share belonging to a bundle also shows a persistent "bundle page" link
right in the admin table (under its `/watch/<token>` link), not just in the
one-time success message shown right after sharing — so the link is easy to
find again later without re-sharing or digging through old messages.

## Access control

### Email-gated links
A share link alone isn't enough to watch the video. The recipient must
type the exact email address the link was shared with; only on a match
does the app send a one-time "magic" sign-in link to that address. This
proves the visitor controls the inbox the link was intended for, not just
that they have the URL.

### Anti-enumeration
The response to a gate attempt is byte-for-byte identical whether the
email matched, didn't match, the link is invalid, revoked, expired, or the
request was throttled. This means the gate can't be used to probe which
email address a given link belongs to, or to enumerate valid links.

### Revocation
Any share can be revoked instantly from the admin table. Revocation is a
flag, not a delete — the record and its history stay intact, and a
recipient's cookie (if they had one) is checked against the live record on
every request, so revocation takes effect even mid-session. Revoking is
idempotent: revoking an already-revoked link succeeds without complaint.

### Rate limiting
Requesting a magic link for the same share is throttled to one per 30
seconds, so the gate can't be used to spam a recipient's inbox.

### Geo location whitelist
An optional list of allowed countries (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes) applied to
every `/watch` and `/bundle` page. The list itself is set via the
`GEO_WHITELIST` environment variable — **not** a Settings-panel field —
deliberately, so it can't be mistyped into a form and saved instantly. The
Settings panel only has an ON/OFF enforcement toggle (`geoWhitelistEnabled`,
off by default, inert until `GEO_WHITELIST` is also set) and a read-only
display of whatever the env var currently contains. When enforced, a
visitor from outside the whitelist sees "This video isn't available in your
region" instead of the email gate, checked before the email/cookie flow
even starts. Detected from Vercel's edge network (`x-vercel-ip-country`),
so it fails **open** — never blocking — when that header is absent (local
dev, or any non-Vercel host): a deployment elsewhere is simply unrestricted
rather than silently locking everyone out. It's a coarse IP-geolocation
signal, the same honesty class as the watermark — a VPN defeats it, and it
complements the email gate's identity check rather than replacing it.

### Admin geo whitelist
The admin page and its API routes can be geo-restricted too, on top of the
`ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS` credentials — same pattern as above, its own env
var (`ADMIN_GEO_WHITELIST`), its own Settings toggle
(`adminGeoWhitelistEnabled`, off by default), and its own read-only display.
Kept as a fully separate list and toggle from the recipient-facing one
above (different risk: locking out an admin vs. a recipient), but the
underlying design reasoning is identical: keeping the list itself out of
the admin-editable UI means recovery from a bad list is always unsetting
the env var in the hosting dashboard and redeploying — a path that doesn't
depend on reaching the app at all. Same fail-open behavior when the geo
header is absent.

A standing bypass, `ADMIN_GEO_BYPASS_EMAILS`, lists Basic Auth usernames
(case-insensitive) that skip the admin geo check entirely, regardless of
country or the enforcement toggle — checked first, before any KV lookup.
It's meant to be armed **before** traveling, not reached for after being
locked out: env var changes need a redeploy, so this only helps if it was
already set. Same env-var-only, read-only-in-Settings pattern as the lists
above.

## Watermarking

Optionally overlay the recipient's verified email address across the video
player as a drifting, tiled watermark. Because every viewer has proven
control of a specific inbox to get in, a leaked screen-recording carries the
email of whoever leaked it — a deterrent against casual re-sharing and a way
to attribute leaks.

Control is layered, resolved per view (most specific wins):

- **Exemptions** — lists of exempt email addresses and exempt domains
  (Settings) that are *never* watermarked, however everything below resolves.
  This is how you exempt internal viewers such as admins or reviewers in an
  app that has no user accounts: by the email or domain they verify with.
  Exemption always wins.
- **Per-share override** — the single and bulk Share forms offer a Default /
  Always / Never choice, so you can force a watermark on (or off) for a
  specific link regardless of the video's or the global setting.
- **Per-video override** — a Default / Always / Never select on each row of
  the Videos grid, so a whole video can default to watermarked (or not)
  without setting it on every share. Stored per Bunny video id.
- **Global default** — a toggle in the admin **Settings** panel that applies
  to any share/video with no override of its own.

Resolution order is **exemption → per-share → per-video → global default**:
an exempt viewer is never watermarked; otherwise a share's own Always/Never
wins; otherwise the video's own Always/Never; otherwise the global default.

Honest limitation: the watermark is a client-side overlay drawn over the
(cross-origin) player, not burned into the video's pixels — doing that would
require per-view server-side transcoding the video host doesn't expose here.
A determined viewer can remove the overlay with browser dev tools. It raises
the effort of a clean leak and attributes the casual ones; it is not DRM.

## Admin actions

Every share in the admin table supports these actions, individually or in
bulk (select multiple rows via checkboxes, then apply the action to all of
them at once — a bad or already-inapplicable link in the selection never
blocks the rest):

- **Resend** — re-send the share's notification email on demand. Works on
  any active share, not only ones whose original send failed — useful when
  a recipient says they never got the email.
- **Extend** — give a recipient more time without changing their link: the
  same token, same URL, same cookie, just a later expiry. Works even on an
  already-expired (but not revoked) share, extending from now rather than
  the old expiry. Refuses to extend a revoked share, so it can never
  quietly double as an "un-revoke." If the share belongs to a bundle, the
  bundle's own expiry is extended to match.
- **Revoke** — immediately cut off access. A flag flip, not a delete, and
  idempotent (revoking an already-revoked share is a no-op success).
- **Restore** — undo a Revoke: flips the flag back, same token/URL/cookie as
  before. Only ever available on a revoked row, and is its own explicit
  action — kept separate from Extend on purpose, so recovering time on a
  live share and undoing a deliberate access cutoff can never be confused
  with each other. Idempotent, same as Revoke. Restoring an already-expired
  share brings back the "Expired" state, not a working link — pair it with
  Extend if the recipient still needs access.
- **Delete permanently** — also only available on a revoked row, this
  actually removes the share record instead of just flagging it, so Restore
  is no longer possible afterward. It's the same deletion `/api/cleanup`
  already does for revoked/expired records, just on demand for one link.
  Requires the share to already be revoked — there's no one-click delete
  from Active, on purpose, so this is always a deliberate second step after
  Revoke, not a shortcut around it.

## Delivery failure handling

If a notification email fails to send (bad SMTP creds, a Resend outage,
etc.), the share link is still created and still works — it's just flagged
in the admin table ("⚠ email failed", with the underlying error shown on
hover) instead of silently existing with nobody told about it. Fix the
mailer configuration and hit Resend to deliver it.

## Tracking

### View tracking
Every time a recipient opens an authorized `/watch` page, the share
record's view count and last-viewed timestamp update. Shown in the admin
table as `N×` with a hover tooltip for the exact time.

### Playback tracking
Separately from views, the app listens to the video player's own events
(play, timeupdate, ended) to track *actual playback*: whether the video was
started, how far it got (25/50/75/100% milestones), and when it completed.
This is deliberately independent of view tracking — opening the page
doesn't mean anyone pressed play, and the admin table shows both so you can
tell "opened" from "actually watched."

Shown in the Watched column as `—` (never played) / `started` / `NN%` /
`100% ✓`.

### Per-video analytics
A collapsible **Analytics** panel on the admin page rolls the per-share
tracking above up per video: how many times it was shared, to how many
distinct recipients, total views, how many recipients started it, how many
completed it (with the completion rate), and the average furthest progress.
It's computed entirely from the tracking already stored on each share — no
extra data is collected for it.

## Resume playback

A recipient who watches part of a video and returns later is offered
"Resume from *m:ss*" (or "Start over") instead of restarting from zero. The
player reports a throttled playback position while watching, and the watch
page seeks to it on request. The offer is suppressed when the saved point is
effectively the end of the video, so someone who finished doesn't get asked
to resume at the credits.

## Email delivery

Emails are sent via [Resend](https://resend.com/)'s HTTP API when
`RESEND_API_KEY` is set, or standard SMTP otherwise (any provider — Brevo,
SMTP2GO, a Gmail app password, Resend's own SMTP bridge, etc.). Every email
in the app — share notifications, bundle notifications, magic links — goes
through this same single delivery path, so switching providers is a config
change, not a code change.

## Maintenance

- **Cleanup** — a single admin action (or scheduled job) purges revoked and
  expired share records and their associated bundle records once nothing
  in them is still valid. Active shares are never touched.
- **`.claude/skills/`** — this repo ships a project-specific skill library
  documenting its architecture, security invariants, operating runbook,
  debugging playbook, and roadmap, intended to let an AI coding session (or
  a new maintainer) work on this codebase without prior context.
