# Bunny Sharing — Debugging Playbook

Triage runbook for the Next.js app in this repo that shares private Bunny.net
Stream videos via time-limited, email-gated `/watch/<token>` links, with share
records in Upstash Redis (KV) and email via Resend (API) or SMTP fallback.

How to use: find your symptom in the master table, then jump to the surface
section for the discriminating experiment. All commands assume cwd = repo root.
Many need env vars loaded; do that first:

```bash
set -a; [ -f .env.local ] && . ./.env.local; [ -f .env ] && . ./.env; set +a
```

(Values containing spaces must be quoted in the env file for this to work. On
Vercel, read the values from the project's Environment Variables page instead.)

Jargon, once:
- **share token** — 32-hex-char id in `/watch/<token>`; KV key `bunnyshare:<token>` (lib/shares.js:13,26).
- **grant** — HMAC-signed proof of email control, `body.sig` in base64url, signed with `GATE_SECRET` (lib/gate.js). Emailed as `?grant=` (15 min TTL), then exchanged for a cookie.
- **gate cookie** — `gate_<token>`, HttpOnly, `Path=/watch/<token>`, lives until share expiry (pages/watch/[token].js:150-153).
- **two Bunny keys** — `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` signs iframe embed URLs (sha256 **hex**); `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` signs direct CDN URLs like thumbnails (sha256 **base64url**). Different keys, different encodings (lib/bunny.js:40-65).

## Master triage table

| Symptom | First check | Likely cause | Fix / section |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thumbnails broken images / 403 in admin grid | `curl -sI` one thumbnail URL | `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` missing or wrong (or it's the embed key by mistake) while pull-zone Token Authentication is ON | S1 |
| Thumbnails simply absent (no `<img>` URL at all) | Is `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE` set? | `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE` unset → `thumbnail: null` (lib/bunny.js:26-28) | S1 |
| Embed iframe black or 403 | Open the iframe `src` directly; compare its `expires` to `date +%s` | `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` wrong, or the page has been open > 1 h (embed URLs are signed for 3600 s at page render, pages/watch/[token].js:171) | S1 |
| Admin video grid empty, NO error shown | `curl` `/api/videos` yourself | API actually 500ing; the UI swallows errors (`vRes.videos \|\| []`, pages/index.js:31) | S1 |
| `/api/videos` returns 500 | Read the JSON `error` field | `BUNNY_API_KEY` / `BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID` wrong — Bunny's own error text is passed through (lib/bunny.js:16, pages/api/videos.js:9) | S1 |
| No share email arrives (share / bulk / magic link) | Which deliver() path is active? (`RESEND_API_KEY` set → API, else SMTP; lib/mailer.js:35). Check the shares table for a "⚠ email failed" badge first — the record already has the error. | Resend: domain/from/key problem. SMTP: port/TLS/auth. | S2 |
| Magic link never arrives though the email "matches" | Did the recipient get "Check your email" (200) or an error (500)? | Mismatch vs throttle vs delivery failure — run the 4-step sequence | S2 |
| Magic link never sends on a link that was bulk-shared to several people; all recipients got the SAME links | `record.email` in KV — does it contain commas/spaces? | Legacy combined-email record (pre-2026-07-19 comma-string bug; failure-archaeology Ep. 9). Gate now matches any listed address, so sign-in works — but the token is shared between those recipients; revoke + re-share for per-person links/tracking | S2 |
| Recipient submits email → error "GATE_SECRET is not set…" | — | `GATE_SECRET` unset in the runtime env (lib/gate.js:14-22); build passes without it, only requests fail | S3 |
| `/watch/<token>` returns 500 | Server logs / `curl` the page | KV unreachable or bad creds — `kvGet` throws inside `getServerSideProps` (lib/kv.js:13-15, pages/watch/[token].js:122) | S3, S5 |
| "That sign-in link has expired" on every click | Time between email and click; `GATE_SECRET` equality across environments | > 15 min elapsed, `GATE_SECRET` rotated/differs, server clock skew, or grant from a different share (token-bound) | S3 |
| Magic link click → silently back to the email form | Was the test over plain http with `SITE_URL=https://…`? | Cookie set with `Secure` but browsed over http → browser drops it (pages/watch/[token].js:146-153) | S3 |
| Cookie works on one share, not another for same viewer | — | By design: cookie is `Path=/watch/<token>`, scoped per share | S3 |
| Browser Basic-Auth prompt loops on `/` or admin APIs | Are `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS` set in the runtime env? | Unset or mismatched — unset can never match (middleware.js:9-18) | S4 |
| `/api/watch/request-link` returns 401 | `git diff` middleware.js matcher | Matcher regressed; must be `"/api/((?!watch/).*)"` (middleware.js:31) | S4 |
| `KV error 401: …` (or other status) in errors/logs | `curl` KV directly | Bad `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` / wrong `KV_REST_API_URL` (lib/kv.js:14) | S5 |
| Share record missing / shares table empty though shares exist | `KEYS bunnyshare:*` vs `KEYS share:*` | Wrong KV database, or records under the pre-30ecd7f `share:` prefix (orphaned) | S5 |
| Build prints `⚠ The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead.` | — | EXPECTED on next 16.2.10. Not an error. Do not rename without change-control. | S6 |

## S1 — Playback and thumbnails

Three distinct signing/auth surfaces (all in lib/bunny.js):
- List videos: Bunny Stream API, `AccessKey: BUNNY_API_KEY` header (lib/bunny.js:10-13).
- Embed iframe: `generateEmbedUrl` → sha256 **hex** of `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY + videoId + expires` (lib/bunny.js:56-65).
- Thumbnails: `signCdnUrl` → sha256 **base64url** (`+`→`-`, `/`→`_`, `=` stripped) of `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY + pathname + expires` (lib/bunny.js:40-52). If `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` is unset the URL is returned unsigned (lib/bunny.js:42).

### Videos list empty or 500

The admin UI hides API errors (pages/index.js:31). Always curl the API:

```bash
curl -s -u "$ADMIN_USER:$ADMIN_PASS" "${SITE_URL:-http://localhost:3000}/api/videos" | head -c 400
```

Branches:
- `{"videos":[…]}` with items → API fine; UI/browser problem (check Basic Auth in browser, S4).
- `{"videos":[]}` → library genuinely empty, or wrong `BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID` pointing at an empty library.
- `{"error":"Bunny API error: 401 …"}` → `BUNNY_API_KEY` wrong. The status/text after "Bunny API error:" is Bunny's own response, passed straight through (lib/bunny.js:16 → pages/api/videos.js:9) — read it, it usually names the problem.
- `{"error":"Bunny API error: 404 …"}` → `BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID` wrong.

Bypass the app entirely to isolate creds:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  -H "AccessKey: $BUNNY_API_KEY" \
  "https://video.bunnycdn.com/library/$BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID/videos?itemsPerPage=1"
# 200 = creds fine (problem is app-side env); 401 = key; 404 = library id
```

### Thumbnails 403 (incident 65dc992 — the two-keys trap)

Grab one thumbnail URL from `/api/videos` output, then:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "<thumbnail-url>"
```

- `200` → thumbnails fine; a broken image in the browser is something else (mixed content, ad-blocker).
- `403` and the URL has **no** `?token=` → pull-zone Token Authentication is ON but `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` is unset (app returned URL unsigned, lib/bunny.js:42). Set it from Bunny: Library > API > "CDN zone management" > Manage > Security > Token Authentication (lib/bunny.js:36-39).
- `403` and the URL **has** `?token=…&expires=…` → key is wrong. The classic mistake is pasting the Embed View Token (`BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY`) here. Verify the signature reproduces:

```bash
node -e '
const c=require("crypto");
const u=new URL(process.argv[1]);
const exp=u.searchParams.get("expires");
let t=c.createHash("sha256").update(process.env.BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY+u.pathname+exp).digest("base64")
  .replace(/\+/g,"-").replace(/\//g,"_").replace(/=/g,"");
console.log(t===u.searchParams.get("token")?"token matches key":"token does NOT match key");
' "<thumbnail-url>"
```

"matches" but still 403 → the key in your env differs from the key Bunny has (rotated), or `expires` already elapsed (signed for 3600 s, lib/bunny.js:40).
- `404` → wrong `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE` hostname.

### Embed iframe black / 403

The `/watch` page signs the embed URL for **3600 s at render time** (pages/watch/[token].js:171, lib/bunny.js:56). Get the iframe `src` (view page source or devtools) and:

```bash
date +%s   # compare with the expires= query param in the iframe src
```

- `expires` < now → tab was open > 1 h; a page refresh mints a fresh URL. Not a bug.
- `expires` in the future but 403/black → `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` wrong (must be the Stream library's Embed View Token, Library > API > Security — NOT the CDN key). Recompute (note: **hex**, not base64url):

```bash
node -e '
const c=require("crypto");
const u=new URL(process.argv[1]);
const videoId=u.pathname.split("/").pop(), exp=u.searchParams.get("expires");
const t=c.createHash("sha256").update(process.env.BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY+videoId+exp).digest("hex");
console.log(t===u.searchParams.get("token")?"token matches key":"token does NOT match key");
' "<iframe-src-url>"
```

- Also check the library id inside the URL path (`/embed/<lib>/<video>`) equals `BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID`, and that embed token authentication is actually enabled on the library (if it's off, Bunny ignores the token — things "work" until someone enables it).

## S2 — Email (nothing arrives)

**Step zero, always: determine which `deliver()` path is active.** lib/mailer.js:35 — if `RESEND_API_KEY` is set (in the RUNTIME env, not just some .env file), every email goes through the Resend HTTP API and all SMTP_* vars are ignored. Otherwise nodemailer SMTP.

```bash
[ -n "$RESEND_API_KEY" ] && echo "Resend API path" || echo "SMTP path"
```

The from address is `RESEND_FROM || SMTP_FROM || SMTP_USER` (lib/mailer.js:24-26) on both paths.

### Resend branch

Failures throw `Resend API error: <message>` (lib/mailer.js:39). What happens next depends on the endpoint (as of 2026-07-20): `/api/share` and `/api/share-bulk` catch each recipient's send failure individually — the KV record(s) still get created, flagged `emailFailed: true` with the error in `emailError` (lib/shares.js `setEmailFailed`), and reported in a `failures` array in the response (200 if at least one recipient succeeded, 500 only if ALL failed). The admin table shows a "⚠ email failed" badge (hover for the error) and a "Resend" button that hits `/api/share/resend` — check there FIRST before re-triggering a whole new share. The magic-link path (`/api/watch/request-link`) is different: it has no record to flag (nothing new is created) and stays behind the uniform anti-enumeration response — see "Magic-link email specifically" below. Typical `emailError`/thrown messages:

- domain not verified (Resend 403) → verify the sending domain in the Resend dashboard, or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for tests.
- invalid `from` (Resend 422) → `RESEND_FROM` (or fallback) is not an address on a verified domain.
- invalid API key (401) → `RESEND_API_KEY` wrong/revoked.

Probe Resend directly, bypassing the app:

```bash
curl -s https://api.resend.com/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"from\":\"${RESEND_FROM}\",\"to\":[\"<your-test-inbox>\"],\"subject\":\"probe\",\"text\":\"probe\"}"
# {"id":"..."} = accepted; anything with "statusCode" = the exact failure
```

Accepted by Resend but not in the inbox → deliverability (spam folder, SPF/DKIM) — see email-delivery-reference. Check the Resend dashboard's Emails log for the delivery status.

### SMTP branch

The transporter sets `secure` **only** when `SMTP_PORT` is exactly 465 (lib/mailer.js:47). Port 587 uses STARTTLS (plain connect, then upgrade) — that is correct; do NOT "fix" it by forcing `secure: true` on 587, which hangs or fails the handshake. Conversely, port 465 with `secure: false` fails too; the code handles both as long as `SMTP_PORT` is accurate.

Probe with the exact same config the app builds:

```bash
node -e '
const n=require("nodemailer");
const t=n.createTransport({host:process.env.SMTP_HOST,port:Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT||587),
  secure:Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT)===465,
  auth:{user:process.env.SMTP_USER,pass:process.env.SMTP_PASS}});
t.verify().then(()=>console.log("SMTP OK: connection + auth accepted"))
 .catch(e=>console.error("SMTP FAIL:", e.message));'
```

Branches by failure text:
- `Invalid login` / `535` → `SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASS` (Gmail needs an app password; Resend-over-SMTP is `smtp.resend.com`, port 587, user `resend`, pass = API key — and requires `RESEND_API_KEY` UNSET or the API path hijacks it).
- `ECONNREFUSED` / timeout → host/port wrong or provider blocks the port.
- TLS/handshake errors → port/`secure` mismatch (see above).
- `SMTP OK` but no mail → provider accepted-then-dropped; check the provider's activity log and sender verification.

### Magic-link email specifically — the discriminating sequence

`/api/watch/request-link` deliberately returns the SAME generic 200 for invalid link, revoked/expired link, mismatched email, throttled, and success (pages/api/watch/request-link.js:20-48) — anti-enumeration invariant, do not "fix". A recipient whose email "matches" but gets nothing needs this sequence:

1. **What did the browser show?** An error message (500) → it got PAST match+throttle and the SEND failed; the message is the mailer error (request-link.js:57-62) — go to the Resend/SMTP branch above. "Check your email" (200) → continue.
2. **Is it actually a match?** Compare against the record, remembering matching is trim+lowercase only (lib/gate.js:32-34) — `Bob@x.com` matches `bob@x.com`, but `bob+tag@x.com` does not:
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KV_REST_API_TOKEN" \
     "$KV_REST_API_URL/get/bunnyshare:<token>"
   # read .email in the JSON; also confirm revoked=false and expiresAt in the future
   ```
   Mismatch / revoked / expired → the uniform 200 hid it. That is by design; create a new share for the right address.
3. **Throttled?** One magic link per share per 30 s (`gatethrottle:<token>`, request-link.js:43-48):
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KV_REST_API_TOKEN" \
     "$KV_REST_API_URL/get/gatethrottle:<token>"
   # {"result":"1"} = throttled right now → wait 30 s, retry; {"result":null} = not throttled
   ```
   Trap: the throttle key is set BEFORE the send (request-link.js:48 vs :57). If the send fails, an immediate retry silently no-ops with a 200 for up to 30 s.
4. **All clear but still nothing** → delivery failed upstream of the inbox: server logs (Vercel function logs) for the 500s from step 1's earlier attempts, provider dashboard, spam folder.

## S3 — Gate / watch page

Flow (pages/watch/[token].js getServerSideProps): load `bunnyshare:<token>` → invalid/revoked/expired page; `?grant=` present and valid → set `gate_<token>` cookie, redirect to clean URL; valid cookie → render iframe; else email form.

### `/watch/<token>` returns 500

`getServerSideProps` has no try/catch — a throwing `kvGet` (KV creds/URL wrong, lib/kv.js:13-15) 500s the whole page. Check server logs for `KV error …`, then go to S5.

Note on `GATE_SECRET`: unset, it does NOT 500 the page render — `verifyGrant` swallows the throw and returns null (lib/gate.js:47-65). It surfaces when the recipient SUBMITS the email form: `signGrant` throws (lib/gate.js:14-22) and request-link returns 500 with the literal message `GATE_SECRET is not set. Add a long random value to your environment to enable email-gated links.` — shown in the gate form. Fail-loud and runtime-only: `next build` succeeds without `GATE_SECRET` (verified 2026-07-18), so a deploy with it missing looks green until the first recipient tries to sign in. Fix: set it (`openssl rand -hex 32`) in the runtime env and redeploy.

### "That sign-in link has expired" every time

That notice (pages/watch/[token].js:157-164) means a `?grant=` was present but `verifyGrant` returned null. Four branches, in order of likelihood:

1. **Genuinely expired** — magic-link grants live 15 min (request-link.js:8, `MAGIC_LINK_TTL_MS`). Recipient clicked an old email. Expected; request a fresh link.
2. **`GATE_SECRET` differs between signer and verifier** — rotated between send and click, or different values across environments (preview vs production on Vercel). Every outstanding grant AND every existing `gate_<token>` cookie dies on rotation. Verify the deployed value is the one you think it is; a quick fingerprint without printing the secret:
   ```bash
   node -e 'const c=require("crypto");console.log(c.createHash("sha256").update(process.env.GATE_SECRET||"UNSET").digest("hex").slice(0,12))'
   ```
   Run wherever emails are sent from and wherever clicks land; fingerprints must match.
3. **Clock skew** — expiry check is `Date.now() > payload.x` (lib/gate.js:60); a server clock minutes fast eats into the 15-min window. Compare `date -u` on the box with real time.
4. **Wrong-token binding** — grants are bound to one share token (lib/gate.js:61). A grant URL pasted onto a different share's `/watch` path verifies as null. By design.

Local self-test that isolates the gate from email/KV entirely:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e '
import { signGrant, verifyGrant } from "./lib/gate.js";
const g = signGrant({ token: "t1", email: "a@b.c", expiresAt: Date.now()+60000 });
console.log("verify same token:", !!verifyGrant(g, { token: "t1" }));   // expect true
console.log("verify other token:", !!verifyGrant(g, { token: "t2" }));  // expect false
'
```

### Magic link click → cookie set → but back at the email form (loop)

The exchange sets the cookie then redirects to the clean URL (pages/watch/[token].js:140-154). If the redirect lands back on the email form, the browser dropped the cookie. Check the `Secure` logic (pages/watch/[token].js:146-149): the flag is added when `x-forwarded-proto` is https OR `SITE_URL` starts with https. So **testing over plain http://localhost with a production-style `SITE_URL=https://…` in your env sets `Secure` on an http response — the browser discards the cookie and you loop**. Fix for local testing: unset `SITE_URL` (or set it to the http localhost URL). In production behind https this never fires.

Also check devtools > Application > Cookies for `gate_<token>`: its Max-Age equals time until share expiry (line 145) — a share expiring in seconds yields a near-dead cookie.

### Cookie works on one share but not another

By design. The cookie is `Path=/watch/<token>` (pages/watch/[token].js:152): one grant per share, so revoking or expiring one share never affects another, and a browser holds independent cookies per share. Each new share requires its own email confirmation. Not a bug; do not widen the Path.

## S4 — Admin / auth

middleware.js applies HTTP Basic Auth with matcher `["/", "/api/((?!watch/).*)"]` (middleware.js:31): `/` and all `/api/*` EXCEPT `/api/watch/*`; `/watch/*` pages are never matched.

### Browser Basic-Auth prompt loops

The check is plain string equality against `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS` (middleware.js:18). If either env var is **unset**, `u === user` compares string to `undefined` — never true, so every attempt 401s and the browser re-prompts forever. Same loop for a plain typo. Discriminate:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -u "$ADMIN_USER:$ADMIN_PASS" \
  "${SITE_URL:-http://localhost:3000}/api/shares"
# 200 → creds fine, the browser has stale cached credentials (try a private window)
# 401 → env values at the server differ from what you're sending (unset or mismatch)
```

On Vercel, confirm the vars exist for the environment you're hitting (production vs preview each have their own set).

### Recipient endpoints returning 401

`/api/watch/request-link` must be PUBLIC — recipients have no admin credentials. If it 401s, the matcher regressed. Verify the exact expression at middleware.js:31 is `"/api/((?!watch/).*)"` (negative lookahead excluding `api/watch/`), then probe unauthenticated:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST \
  "${SITE_URL:-http://localhost:3000}/api/watch/request-link" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"token":"probe","email":"probe@example.com"}'
# 200 (generic anti-enumeration response) = correct. 401 = matcher broken.
```

This is invariant territory: `/api/watch/*` and `/watch/*` stay public, everything else stays behind auth. Route any matcher change through bunny-sharing-change-control.

## S5 — KV (Upstash Redis)

lib/kv.js is a REST wrapper; any non-OK response throws `KV error <status>: <body>` (lib/kv.js:14). That error text bubbles into API 500 JSON and into `/watch` page 500s.

### `KV error 401/…`

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KV_REST_API_TOKEN" "$KV_REST_API_URL/get/probe-nonexistent"
# {"result":null}  → URL + token both fine
# {"error":"..."} / 401 → KV_REST_API_TOKEN wrong (or read-only token used for writes)
# DNS/connection failure → KV_REST_API_URL wrong
```

### Record missing / shares table empty though shares exist

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KV_REST_API_TOKEN" "$KV_REST_API_URL/keys/bunnyshare:*"
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KV_REST_API_TOKEN" "$KV_REST_API_URL/keys/share:*"
```

Branches:
- `bunnyshare:*` empty, `share:*` has keys → orphaned pre-30ecd7f records: commit 30ecd7f (2026-07-03) silently migrated the prefix `share:` → `bunnyshare:` with no data migration, stranding earlier records. Current code reads only `bunnyshare:` (lib/shares.js:26, pages/watch/[token].js:122, pages/api/shares.js:6). Those old links are dead; re-share, or copy records to the new prefix if they must revive.
- Both empty but you created shares recently → you are pointed at a DIFFERENT database than the app (local `.env.local` vs Vercel env often diverge). Compare `KV_REST_API_URL` in both places.
- Keys exist but shares table still empty in the UI → curl `/api/shares` with admin creds and read the error; also note a specific record vanishing after "Cleanup" is expected if it was revoked or expired (pages/api/cleanup.js:9-13).
- Revoked share still listed → correct: revoke is a flag flip, never a delete (pages/api/revoke.js:12-13); only Cleanup deletes.

## S6 — Build / dev

`npm run build` on next 16.2.10 prints:

```
⚠ The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead.
```

This is EXPECTED (reproduced 2026-07-18, build succeeds). It is a deprecation notice, not an error, and the route summary still shows `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`. Do NOT "fix" it by renaming middleware.js → proxy.js in passing: the middleware carries the auth-boundary invariant (S4) and the rename is a behavior-affecting change that goes through bunny-sharing-change-control with the S4 public-endpoint probe as verification.

Also expected: build succeeds with ZERO env vars set (verified 2026-07-18) — every config failure in this playbook is runtime-only. A green build proves nothing about configuration.

## Traps that cost real time

**The two Bunny keys.** Bunny has two unrelated token-auth schemes and this app uses both: `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` (the Stream library's Embed View Token) signs iframe embed URLs as sha256 hex, while `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` (the pull zone's Token Authentication key, buried under Library > API > "CDN zone management" > Manage > Security) signs direct CDN URLs like thumbnails as base64url with `+/=` rewritten (lib/bunny.js:40-65). Before commit 65dc992 (2026-07-14) the app only knew the first key, so enabling pull-zone Token Authentication made every thumbnail 403 while embeds kept working — a baffling half-broken state. If exactly one of {thumbnails, embeds} is 403ing, suspect the corresponding key before anything else, and never assume one key serves both.

**The verify()-per-send arc (7490382 → 30ecd7f).** Early mailer hardening (commits 7490382/4d9189f/1a2e4db, 2026-07-02) added env validation, `transporter.verify()` before every send, `requireTLS`, and emoji-decorated console logging of message IDs and accepted/rejected recipients. Commit 30ecd7f ("Fix", 2026-07-03) stripped all of it: verify-per-send doubled SMTP round-trips and produced its own failures, and the logs leaked recipient addresses. Today's mailer is deliberately minimal (lib/mailer.js:44-53). If email debugging tempts you to re-add per-send `verify()` or chatty logging, don't — run the standalone verify probe in S2 instead, which gives the same signal without touching production code.

**The prefix migration (30ecd7f).** The same "Fix" commit also renamed the KV key prefix `share:` → `bunnyshare:` with no migration, instantly orphaning every share created before it — live links died silently. This is the cautionary tale behind the repo's prime directive (never break live links) and the reason S5 tells you to check BOTH prefixes when a record has vanished. Any future change to key names, record fields, `/watch/<token>` URL shape, or the `gate_<token>` cookie must treat existing data as immovable.

**`secure` iff port 465.** `secure: Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT) === 465` (lib/mailer.js:47) looks like a bug to fresh eyes and gets "corrected" to `true`. It is right: 465 is implicit TLS from byte one; 587 must connect plain and upgrade via STARTTLS, which nodemailer does automatically when `secure: false`. Forcing `secure: true` on 587 stalls the handshake against a plaintext greeting; leaving it false on 465 fails the other way. The only knob that should change is `SMTP_PORT` itself, and the flag follows.

## When NOT to use this skill

- **Setting up from scratch** (fresh env, which vars to obtain where) → bunny-sharing-env-and-setup.
- **Running the packaged measurement/probe scripts** (KV inspect, gate self-test, email probe, etc.) → bunny-sharing-diagnostics; this playbook inlines minimal one-liners only.
- **Why the history went this way** (full incident chronicle, evidence, decisions) → bunny-sharing-failure-archaeology.
- **Live-proving the email gate end to end** against real Resend/Bunny/KV → bunny-sharing-email-gate-campaign.
- **Deciding whether a fix is safe to ship** → bunny-sharing-change-control.

## Provenance and maintenance

Written 2026-07-18 against branch `claude/bulk-share-separate-links-auth-cblrle` @ 5905bba; every cited line was read in that tree and the build warning + no-env build were reproduced the same day. Re-verify before trusting drifted facts:

```bash
git log --oneline -1                                          # still near 5905bba?
grep -n "RESEND_API_KEY" lib/mailer.js                        # deliver() path selection (~:35)
grep -n "465" lib/mailer.js                                   # secure-iff-465 (~:47)
grep -n "matcher" middleware.js                               # auth matcher (~:31)
grep -n "MAGIC_LINK_TTL_MS\|THROTTLE_SECONDS" pages/api/watch/request-link.js   # 15 min / 30 s
grep -n "bunnyshare:\|gatethrottle:" -r pages lib             # KV key prefixes
grep -n "generateEmbedUrl(record.videoId" pages/watch/[token].js  # 3600 s embed signing
grep -rn "digest(\"hex\")\|digest(\"base64\")" lib/bunny.js   # two encodings, two keys
npm run build 2>&1 | grep middleware                          # deprecation warning still expected?
```

If any grep comes back empty or on a different line, re-read that file before following this playbook's advice — the repo always wins over this document.
