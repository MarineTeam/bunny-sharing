  Change-control policy for the bunny-sharing repo: how to classify a proposed
  change (safe / behavior-affecting / compatibility-critical / security-sensitive),
  which non-negotiable invariants must never be weakened (with the incidents behind
  them), the exact pre-push verification commands, the checklist for touching any
  compatibility-critical surface (tokens, bunnyshare:* records, /watch URLs,
  gate_<token> cookies, GATE_SECRET, grant format), and the documentation that must
  ship in the same change. Load this BEFORE editing or pushing any change to this
  repo, and when reviewing a diff. Do NOT load it for debugging a live failure
  (use bunny-sharing-debugging-playbook), for the history/why behind a decision
  (use bunny-sharing-failure-archaeology), or for detailed test-evidence standards
  (use bunny-sharing-validation-and-qa).

# Change control for bunny-sharing

This repo issues live, emailed `/watch/<token>` links to outside recipients. There
are no automated tests and no CI (as of 2026-07-18; two scanner workflows were
added and deleted in the past — do not assume CI exists). Verification is manual,
so this protocol IS the safety net. Follow it before every push.

**Prime directive (maintainer-stated): NEVER BREAK LIVE LINKS.** Every token ever
emailed must keep resolving; every `bunnyshare:*` record already in Redis must keep
being readable; every `gate_<token>` cookie already set in a recipient's browser
must keep verifying. A change that is correct for new shares but breaks old ones
is a failed change.

Jargon, once:
- **share record** — JSON at Redis key `bunnyshare:<token>` with fields
  `{token, videoId, videoTitle, email, createdAt, expiresAt, revoked}`
  (lib/shares.js, `createShareRecord`).
- **grant** — stateless HMAC-SHA256 credential `b64url(payload).b64url(sig)`
  signed with `GATE_SECRET` (lib/gate.js). Emailed as `?grant=` (15-min magic
  link), then exchanged for a cookie grant.
- **gate cookie** — `gate_<token>`, HttpOnly, `Path=/watch/<token>`, set in
  `pages/watch/[token].js` (`cookieName()` at line 105, Set-Cookie around line 152).

## 1. Change classification

Classify the diff FIRST. A diff takes the class of its most dangerous file. When
in doubt, classify UP.

| Class | Examples in this repo | Required verification before push |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (a) Safe | README prose, comments, inline `styles` objects in pages/index.js or pages/watch/[token].js, admin-UI cosmetics (labels, layout) that do not change fetch calls or form payloads | `npm run build` succeeds |
| (b) Behavior-affecting | pages/api/* handler logic, lib/mailer.js routing/templates, lib/bunny.js, lib/kv.js, middleware.js (including any rename to the `proxy` convention — the build's deprecation warning tempts this; renaming changes auth coverage and is NOT cosmetic), admin UI flows (share modal, bulk bar, revoke button payloads), cleanup logic | Full protocol in section 3, plus manually exercise the changed flow end-to-end (dev server or deploy preview) |
| (c) Compatibility-critical | Anything touching: token format (`crypto.randomBytes(16).toString("hex")`, lib/shares.js:13), the `bunnyshare:` key prefix or record field names/meanings, `/watch/<token>` URL shape, `gate_<token>` cookie name or its `Path=/watch/<token>`, GATE_SECRET semantics (what is signed, how, with what), grant payload/format (`{t,e,x}` + b64url encoding), the `gatethrottle:<token>` key only if repurposed | Section 3 protocol PLUS the backward-compat checklist in section 4. Old artifacts must demonstrably still work |
| (d) Security-sensitive | lib/mailer.js HTML construction (escapeHtml/isValidUrl paths), pages/api/watch/request-link.js responses, middleware.js matcher/auth logic, lib/gate.js crypto, baseUrl() in lib/shares.js | Section 3 protocol PLUS re-verify every invariant grep in section 3 step 3, and re-read section 2 line by line against the diff |

Classes overlap: middleware.js is both (b) and (d); lib/gate.js is (c) AND (d).
Apply the union of requirements.

## 2. Non-negotiables

Each entry: the rule, why, and the incident it comes from. Verify incidents
yourself with read-only `git show <hash>`. Never weaken these; if a change seems
to require it, stop and escalate to the maintainer.

1. **NEVER BREAK LIVE LINKS** — the prime directive, above all others.
   *Incident:* commit `30ecd7f` ("Fix", 2026-07-03) silently migrated the KV key
   prefix `share:` → `bunnyshare:` with no data migration, orphaning every record
   created before it — all previously emailed links died. It also bundled two
   other unrelated decisions into one unlabeled commit. Lessons: (a) any
   read-path key/format change must keep reading old data or migrate it;
   (b) one decision per commit, labeled.

2. **All user-controlled strings in email HTML pass through `escapeHtml`; all
   links pass `isValidUrl`** (lib/mailer.js:4-22; used by all three senders).
   *Why:* video titles and links land in HTML email bodies; unescaped input is
   stored XSS in the recipient's mail client, and unvalidated links let a forged
   Host header poison the emailed URL.
   *Incident:* `29fb9be` (2026-07-10) fixed CodeQL alerts for exactly this — XSS
   and host-header poisoning in email generation.

3. **`baseUrl()` fallback stays `https://`** (lib/shares.js:6:
   `SITE_URL || \`https://${req.headers.host}\``).
   *Why:* same host-header-poisoning class as #2 — an attacker-supplied Host must
   never yield an http link that can be intercepted.
   *Incident:* the `http:` → `https:` fallback flip landed in `30ecd7f`
   (verify: `git show 30ecd7f -- pages/api/share.js | grep https`); the broader
   host-header issue was flagged by CodeQL and addressed in `29fb9be`.

4. **`/api/watch/request-link` returns the IDENTICAL generic 200 for invalid
   link, revoked/expired share, mismatched email, throttled, AND success**
   (`genericOk()` in pages/api/watch/request-link.js:20-24, returned at four
   sites). *Why:* anti-enumeration — the public endpoint must not let anyone
   probe which email a link belongs to, or whether a token is live. Any new
   branch in that handler must return `genericOk()`, not a distinguishable
   response, status code, or timing-obvious shortcut.

5. **GATE_SECRET has no default; the gate fails loud** (lib/gate.js:14-22,
   `secret()` throws when unset). *Why:* a silent fallback secret means a
   misconfigured deploy signs forgeable grants — worse than an outage.
   Runtime-only: `next build` succeeds without it (verified 2026-07-18).

6. **Grant verification uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual`, grants are token-bound and
   expiring, and `verifyGrant` never throws on malformed input**
   (lib/gate.js:47-66). *Why:* non-constant-time comparison leaks signature
   bytes; unbound grants would let one share's grant unlock another; throwing on
   garbage input turns probing into 500s.

7. **The middleware matcher keeps `/api/watch/*` public and everything else in
   `/api` plus `/` behind Basic Auth; `/watch/*` pages stay OUT of the matcher**
   (middleware.js:31: `matcher: ["/", "/api/((?!watch/).*)"]`). *Why:* recipients
   have no admin credentials — if the matcher swallows `/api/watch/*` or
   `/watch/*`, every live link breaks behind a 401 (a prime-directive violation);
   if it stops covering the rest of `/api`, the whole admin surface is public.

8. **Bulk share = one token/record/link PER video** (pages/api/share-bulk.js
   loops `createShareRecord` per video; lib/shares.js generates a fresh random
   token per call). *Why:* independent revocation and expiry per video —
   deliberate design of the bulk feature (`7e2c016`). Never "optimize" into one
   shared token.

9. **Revoke = flag flip, never delete** (pages/api/revoke.js:12-13 sets
   `record.revoked = true` and writes back). *Why:* revocation must be
   auditable and reversible; deletion is cleanup's job (pages/api/cleanup.js
   deletes only revoked-or-expired records). Deleting on revoke would also make
   a revoked link indistinguishable from a never-existing one in the admin table.

## 3. Pre-push verification protocol

Run from the repo root, in order. All must pass for class (b)+; step 1 alone
suffices for class (a).

**Step 1 — build (no env required).**
```bash
npm run build
```
Must succeed with zero errors. As of 2026-07-18 it succeeds with NO env vars set
(GATE_SECRET included — it is runtime-only) and prints one expected warning:
`The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead.`
That warning is known and deliberate — do not "fix" it as a drive-by (see
section 1 class (b)). The route list must still show `ƒ /api/watch/request-link`,
`ƒ /watch/[token]`, and `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`.

**Step 2 — gate crypto self-test** (required whenever lib/gate.js, GATE_SECRET
handling, or pages/watch/[token].js grant logic changed; cheap enough to run
always). Use the self-test script in the **bunny-sharing-diagnostics** skill
(`.claude/skills/bunny-sharing-diagnostics/`) — it signs a grant and asserts
verify-roundtrip, expiry rejection, wrong-token rejection, and tamper rejection.
Do not hand-roll a variant here; keep one canonical script.

**Step 3 — invariant greps.** Each command's output must match the stated
expectation; a mismatch means an invariant moved and the diff needs re-review.

```bash
# Matcher still has the negative lookahead keeping /api/watch/* public:
grep -n "watch/" middleware.js
# EXPECT a line: matcher: ["/", "/api/((?!watch/).*)"]

# KV prefix untouched — every read/write still uses bunnyshare:
grep -rn "bunnyshare:" lib pages
# EXPECT hits in: lib/shares.js, pages/watch/[token].js,
# pages/api/watch/request-link.js, pages/api/shares.js, pages/api/revoke.js,
# pages/api/cleanup.js — and NO other prefix:
# `grep -rn "share:" lib pages | grep -v bunnyshare:` must print NOTHING
# (no legacy bare `share:` keys may reappear)

# Cookie name/path unchanged:
grep -n "gate_" "pages/watch/[token].js"
# EXPECT: return `gate_${token}`;  (and Set-Cookie uses Path=/watch/${token})

# https fallback intact:
grep -n "https://" lib/shares.js
# EXPECT: process.env.SITE_URL || `https://${req.headers.host}`

# Uniform request-link responses — every outcome branch returns genericOk:
grep -n "genericOk" pages/api/watch/request-link.js
# EXPECT: 1 definition + 4 return sites (missing/revoked/expired, email
# mismatch, throttled, success)

# Fail-loud secret and constant-time compare still present:
grep -n "GATE_SECRET\|timingSafeEqual" lib/gate.js
# EXPECT: the throw-if-unset in secret(), and timingSafeEqual in verifyGrant

# Escaping still applied in mailer:
grep -n "escapeHtml\|isValidUrl" lib/mailer.js
# EXPECT: both defined and used in ALL of sendShareEmail, sendBulkShareEmail,
# sendMagicLinkEmail

# Revoke still flags, never deletes:
grep -n "revoked = true\|kvDel" pages/api/revoke.js
# EXPECT: `record.revoked = true` present; kvDel ABSENT
```

**Step 4 — exercise the changed flow** (class (b)+). `npm run dev` with a filled
`.env.local` and walk the affected path end-to-end (create share → email →
/watch → email gate → magic link → playback, as applicable). What counts as
sufficient evidence per surface is defined in **bunny-sharing-validation-and-qa**;
runnable probes live in **bunny-sharing-diagnostics**.

## 4. Changing a compatibility-critical surface (class c)

Almost never do this. If you must, the change is only pushable with ALL of the
following backward-compat evidence, gathered against records/cookies created by
the CURRENT code before your change:

- [ ] **Old token still resolves.** Create a share on the pre-change code, then
      run the post-change code against the same Redis: `GET /watch/<old-token>`
      renders the email gate (not "Link not found").
- [ ] **Old record shape still reads.** Every consumer (`pages/watch/[token].js`,
      shares list, revoke, cleanup, request-link) handles a record with exactly
      the old fields `{token, videoId, videoTitle, email, createdAt, expiresAt,
      revoked}`. New fields must be optional with safe defaults; no field may be
      renamed or change meaning.
- [ ] **Old cookie still verifies.** A `gate_<token>` cookie minted pre-change
      (same GATE_SECRET) still passes `verifyGrant` post-change and plays the
      video without re-gating the recipient.
- [ ] **Old emailed magic link still works** within its 15-min TTL across the
      deploy: `?grant=` signed pre-change verifies post-change.
- [ ] **Key prefix:** if the prefix or key layout changes at all, ship a
      migration that copies/aliases every existing `bunnyshare:*` key BEFORE the
      read path changes, and prove it against production-shaped data. (This is
      the exact failure of `30ecd7f` — do not repeat it.)
- [ ] **GATE_SECRET rotation** counts as a class (c) change: it invalidates every
      outstanding cookie and magic link. Only acceptable with maintainer intent
      (e.g. suspected leak), stated in the commit message.
- [ ] The commit message names the surface changed and the compat evidence
      collected — one decision per commit, labeled (anti-`30ecd7f`).

## 5. Documentation obligations (same commit, not a follow-up)

Verified present as of 2026-07-18:
- README.md has an **Environment variables** table (starts line 39) and an
  **API routes** table (starts line 55).
- `.env.example` lists every env var with comments.

Rules:
- Add/rename/remove an env var → update ALL THREE in the same change: README
  env-var table, `.env.example`, and any behavior notes (e.g. the
  RESEND_API_KEY-wins-over-SMTP selection rule).
- Add/rename/remove an API route → update the README API routes table in the
  same change, and state whether the route is behind Basic Auth or public
  (public requires a matcher decision — see non-negotiable 7).
- If the change alters recipient-visible behavior (/watch flow, emails), update
  the README "How it works" section.

## 6. When NOT to use this skill

- **Something is broken and you're diagnosing it** → bunny-sharing-debugging-playbook
  (symptom → triage). Come back here before pushing the fix.
- **You want the history or the "why" behind a decision/incident** →
  bunny-sharing-failure-archaeology (full chronicle; this skill only cites hashes).
- **You need the detailed standard for what counts as test evidence, or E2E
  checklists per surface** → bunny-sharing-validation-and-qa.
- **You need runnable probes/self-tests** → bunny-sharing-diagnostics.
- **You're deciding architecture, not gating a diff** → bunny-sharing-architecture-contract.

## Provenance and maintenance

Facts verified against the working tree on 2026-07-18 (branch
`claude/bulk-share-separate-links-auth-cblrle`, HEAD `5905bba`). Re-verify with:

- Matcher: `grep -n "matcher" middleware.js` (expect `["/", "/api/((?!watch/).*)"]`)
- Prefix + record shape: `grep -rn "bunnyshare:" lib pages` and `sed -n '12,30p' lib/shares.js`
- Cookie name/path: `grep -n "gate_\|Path=/watch" "pages/watch/[token].js"`
- Fail-loud secret / timingSafeEqual: `grep -n "GATE_SECRET\|timingSafeEqual" lib/gate.js`
- Uniform responses: `grep -n "genericOk" pages/api/watch/request-link.js` (1 def + 4 returns)
- Revoke-is-flag: `grep -n "revoked = true" pages/api/revoke.js`
- Build-without-secret claim: `env -u GATE_SECRET npm run build` (rerun if Next.js is upgraded; deprecation warning text may change)
- Incidents: `git show --stat 30ecd7f` and `git show 29fb9be -- lib/mailer.js`
- Doc tables: `grep -n "Environment variables\|API routes" README.md`; `cat .env.example`
