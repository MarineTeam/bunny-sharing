# Environment and Setup — Bunny Video Sharing

This app has no config files, no feature flags, no database migrations. **Its
entire configuration surface is 17 environment variables.** Every one is read
via `process.env` at request time (never at module top level, except `lib/kv.js`
which captures the two KV vars at import — same effect in practice, since server
env is fixed at process start). This skill catalogs all of them with exact
read sites and verified failure modes, then gives the from-scratch runbook.

Verified against the repo on 2026-07-18 (branch `claude/bulk-share-separate-links-auth-cblrle`, commit 5905bba).

Jargon, defined once:
- **Share record** — JSON stored in Upstash Redis at key `bunnyshare:<token>`; one per share link.
- **Magic link / grant** — HMAC-signed proof (signed with `GATE_SECRET`) that a recipient controls the email a share was sent to. See `lib/gate.js`.
- **Pull zone** — the Bunny CDN zone serving your Stream library's static assets (thumbnails etc.), e.g. `vz-xxxx.b-cdn.net`.

## 1. Env-var catalog

One row per variable. "Read in" cites the exact file and symbol. Failure modes
below were derived by reading each call path (file:line refs as of 2026-07-18).

| Var | Read in | Required? | Default / fallback | Failure mode when missing/wrong | Prod vs optional |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID` | `lib/bunny.js:7` (`listVideos`), `lib/bunny.js:58` (`generateEmbedUrl`) | Yes | none | Missing: `listVideos` fetches `.../library/undefined/videos` → Bunny API error → `/api/videos` returns 500 → admin grid empty. `generateEmbedUrl` silently builds `embed/undefined/<video>` → recipient player broken (no server error). | Required everywhere |
| `BUNNY_API_KEY` | `lib/bunny.js:8` (`listVideos`) | Yes | none | Missing/wrong: Bunny returns 401 → `listVideos` throws → `/api/videos` 500. Share/watch flows for existing records unaffected (they never call the Bunny API). | Required everywhere |
| `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` | `lib/bunny.js:57` (`generateEmbedUrl`) | Yes (if library Embed View Token Auth is on) | none — missing key is concatenated as the string `"undefined"` into the hash | No throw, no 500. The embed token is simply wrong; the Bunny iframe rejects it and the recipient sees the player's auth error. If the library's embed token auth is OFF, the bogus `?token=` is ignored and playback still works — a trap that hides misconfiguration until you enable token auth. | Required in prod (token auth should be on) |
| `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE` | `lib/bunny.js:20` (`listVideos`) | No | `thumbnail: null` when unset | Graceful: admin grid renders without thumbnail images (`pages/index.js:160` guards with `v.thumbnail &&`). Everything else works. | Optional |
| `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` | `lib/bunny.js:41` (`signCdnUrl`) | Only if pull-zone Token Authentication is ON | unset → `signCdnUrl` returns the URL unsigned (`lib/bunny.js:42`) | With pull-zone token auth ON and this unset: thumbnails 403 in the admin grid, but **embeds still play fine** (embeds use `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY`, a different key). With token auth OFF: harmless either way. This exact confusion caused incident 65dc992 — see bunny-stream-reference. | Optional (conditional) |
| `SITE_URL` | `lib/shares.js:6` (`baseUrl`), `pages/watch/[token].js:148` (cookie `Secure` heuristic) | No, but strongly recommended | falls back to `https://<request Host header>` (https deliberately forced — host-header-poisoning fix, incident 29fb9be) | Unset in local dev: emailed links become `https://localhost:3000` — https where dev serves http, so links from a dev box don't open. Unset in prod behind a proxy: links use whatever Host the proxy passes. Also feeds the cookie `Secure` flag when `x-forwarded-proto` is absent. Set it. | Recommended everywhere; effectively required for correct emailed links in dev |
| `ADMIN_USER` | `middleware.js:9` | Yes | none | Missing (either var): the string comparison at `middleware.js:18` can never succeed against `undefined` → **permanent 401 on `/` and all admin API routes** — total admin lockout. `/watch/*` and `/api/watch/*` stay reachable (outside the matcher). | Required everywhere |
| `ADMIN_PASS` | `middleware.js:10` | Yes | none | Same as `ADMIN_USER`. | Required everywhere |
| `GATE_SECRET` | `lib/gate.js:15` (`secret()`, called by `signGrant` and `verifyGrant`) | Yes at runtime | none — `secret()` **throws** ("GATE_SECRET is not set…"); deliberately no insecure default | Build unaffected: `next build` succeeds without it (read is call-time, `/watch` is SSR). Runtime, precisely: `/watch/<token>` does **not** 500 — `verifyGrant` wraps everything in try/catch (`lib/gate.js:47-65`), so the throw is swallowed and the page falls back to the email form. The visible failure is `POST /api/watch/request-link` **with a matching email** → 500 `{"error":"GATE_SECRET is not set…"}` via `signGrant` (`request-link.js:50` → handler catch). Non-matching email / invalid token still return the generic 200. Net effect: recipients can never get in; the loud error only surfaces on a matching request-link call. | Required everywhere |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `lib/mailer.js:35-36` (`deliver`) | One email path required | unset → SMTP fallback path | Presence selects the Resend HTTP API path (SMTP vars then ignored). Wrong key: Resend returns an error → `deliver` throws → 500 from `/api/share`, `/api/share-bulk`, `/api/watch/request-link`. **Trap:** share/share-bulk store the record BEFORE emailing, so a failed send leaves a live record with no delivered email. | Either this or SMTP set |
| `RESEND_FROM` | `lib/mailer.js:25` (`fromAddress`) | With Resend path: effectively yes | falls back to `SMTP_FROM`, then `SMTP_USER` | If the whole chain is empty, `from` is `undefined` → provider rejects → send throws → 500 (record already stored, as above). Resend also rejects senders not verified on your Resend domain. | Required when using Resend |
| `SMTP_HOST` | `lib/mailer.js:45` (`deliver`) | Required on SMTP path | none | Missing/wrong (with `RESEND_API_KEY` unset): nodemailer connection error → send throws → 500 on the three emailing routes; record already stored. | Required iff SMTP path |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `lib/mailer.js:46-47` | No | `587` (`Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT || 587)`) | `secure` is true **iff** the value is exactly `465` (implicit TLS); anything else, including the 587 default, uses STARTTLS. Wrong port → connection/TLS handshake failure → send throws → 500. | Optional (default 587) |
| `SMTP_USER` | `lib/mailer.js:49`; also third link in `fromAddress` chain (`lib/mailer.js:25`) | Required on SMTP path | none | Auth failure → send throws → 500. Note it doubles as the last-resort from-address. | Required iff SMTP path |
| `SMTP_PASS` | `lib/mailer.js:50` | Required on SMTP path | none | Auth failure → send throws → 500. | Required iff SMTP path |
| `SMTP_FROM` | `lib/mailer.js:25` (`fromAddress`) | No | falls back to `SMTP_USER` | Only cosmetic/deliverability: sets the From header on the SMTP path (and is the second fallback even on the Resend path). | Optional |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` | `lib/kv.js:6` (module const, used by `kvFetch`) | Yes | none | Missing: `fetch("undefined/get/…")` → URL-parse TypeError → **500 on every KV-touching surface**: `/api/share`, `/api/share-bulk`, `/api/shares`, `/api/revoke`, `/api/cleanup`, `/api/watch/request-link`, and `/watch/<token>` SSR (Next error page). Only `/api/videos` and the static admin shell survive. Read at module import — changing it requires a process restart. | Required everywhere |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | `lib/kv.js:7` | Yes | none | Missing/wrong: Upstash returns 401 → `kvFetch` throws `KV error 401` → same 500 blast radius as above. | Required everywhere |

Not in the catalog because they are not read anywhere: there are no other
`process.env` reads in `lib/`, `pages/`, or `middleware.js` (verified with the
grep in Provenance). `NODE_ENV` is handled by Next.js itself.

## 2. Config precedence rules (all of them — verified in code)

1. **Email path selection** (`lib/mailer.js:35`): `RESEND_API_KEY` set → Resend
   HTTP API; unset → nodemailer SMTP. Binary, presence-based. All SMTP vars are
   ignored when the Resend path is active (except as from-address fallbacks).
   Alternative: Resend-over-SMTP works too (host `smtp.resend.com`, port 587,
   user `resend`, pass = API key) — but only if you leave `RESEND_API_KEY`
   unset, otherwise the API path wins.
2. **From-address chain** (`lib/mailer.js:24-26`):
   `RESEND_FROM` → `SMTP_FROM` → `SMTP_USER` → `undefined` (send fails).
3. **Link base URL** (`lib/shares.js:5-7`): `SITE_URL` → `https://<Host header>`.
   The fallback forces `https` on purpose (host-header-poisoning remediation);
   do not "fix" it to mirror the request protocol.
4. **SMTP port** (`lib/mailer.js:46-47`): default `587`; implicit TLS
   (`secure: true`) only when the port is exactly `465`.
5. **Share expiry hours** (`lib/shares.js:14`): request-body `hours`, falsy →
   `72` (`Number(hours) || 72` — so `0` also means 72).
6. **Cookie `Secure` flag** (`pages/watch/[token].js:146-149`):
   `x-forwarded-proto` header → else `https` iff `SITE_URL` starts with
   `https` → else `http` (no Secure flag).

## 3. From-scratch setup runbook

Assumes cwd = repo root, Node ~v22, npm available.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # .env.local is git-ignored (.gitignore:26)
```

Fill `.env.local`. Where each value lives:

| Value | Where to get it |
| --- | --- |
| `BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID`, `BUNNY_API_KEY` | Bunny dashboard → Stream → your library → API. The API key is the library-level key sent as the `AccessKey` header. |
| `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` | Same library → API → Security: the **Embed View Token Authentication** key. |
| `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE` | The library's pull-zone hostname, e.g. `vz-xxxxxxxx-abc.b-cdn.net`. |
| `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` | Library → API → "CDN zone management" → Manage → Security → Token Authentication (per `.env.example:6-8` and the comment block at `lib/bunny.js:32-39`). Only if that toggle is ON. **Not the same key as `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY`** — two keys, two signing schemes; see bunny-stream-reference. |
| `SITE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` for dev; your public https URL in prod. |
| `ADMIN_USER` / `ADMIN_PASS` | Invent them; they are the Basic Auth credentials (plaintext compare in `middleware.js`). |
| `GATE_SECRET` | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` / `RESEND_FROM` | resend.com → API Keys; `RESEND_FROM` must be a verified sender on your Resend domain. |
| `SMTP_*` | Only if not using Resend: any SMTP provider (Brevo, SMTP2GO, Gmail app password…). |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Upstash console → your Redis DB → REST API section — or Vercel Storage tab ("Upstash for Redis"), which injects the same two names. |

Then:

```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000 and sign in with ADMIN_USER / ADMIN_PASS
```

There is no test suite and no lint script — `dev`, `build`, `start` are the
only npm scripts (`package.json`).

### Minimal-viable subsets

- **Build only**: `npm run build` needs **zero** env vars (verified 2026-07-18:
  every read is call-time / SSR-time). Expect a deprecation warning about the
  `middleware` file convention — known, deliberate; do not rename
  `middleware.js` (see bunny-sharing-change-control).
- **UI smoke without real accounts** (`npm run dev` with only
  `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS` set):
  - Works: admin page loads after Basic Auth; layout renders.
  - Fails gracefully: no `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE` → no thumbnails; no
    `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` → unsigned thumbnail URLs.
  - Fails hard (500 JSON, page still up): `/api/videos` (no Bunny creds),
    `/api/shares` and every share action (no KV), `/watch/<anything>` (KV
    throw inside SSR → Next error page).
  - Omit `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS` and you get an unrecoverable 401 on `/`.
- **Full local run** needs: Bunny trio (+ pull zone vars for thumbnails), KV
  pair, `GATE_SECRET`, one email path, `SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000`.

## 4. Adding a new env var — checklist

The house style has exactly two failure-mode patterns; pick one deliberately:

- **Fail-loud** (secrets whose absence must never be silently defaulted):
  `GATE_SECRET` — `lib/gate.js:14-22` throws with an actionable message, no
  fallback. (Caveat to imitate better than the original: a swallowing
  try/catch downstream, like `verifyGrant`'s, can mute the loudness — decide
  where the throw surfaces.)
- **Graceful-degrade** (optional capability): `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` —
  `lib/bunny.js:41-42` returns the unsigned URL when unset, feature simply off.

Checklist:

1. Add the read site in code; read it inside the function (call-time), not at
   module top level, so builds stay env-free and tests/scripts can set it late.
2. Choose fail-loud vs graceful (above) and make the failure mode explicit.
3. Add the var to `.env.example` with a comment saying what it is, where to get
   it, and when it may be left blank (match the existing comment style).
4. Add a row to the README "Environment variables" table (`README.md:39-51`).
5. Add a row to the catalog in **this skill** (section 1), including the
   verified failure mode.
6. If deploying on Vercel: add it to each environment (Production / Preview /
   Development) in the dashboard — envs there are per-environment, not global.
7. Route the change through bunny-sharing-change-control (a new required var is
   a deploy-breaking class of change).

## 5. Known traps

- **`.env.local` is git-ignored** (`.gitignore:25-27`: `.env.local`,
  `.env.*.local`) — correct, but it means a fresh clone has no config at all
  and secrets must be re-provisioned per machine. Plain `.env` is NOT in
  `.gitignore`; use `.env.local`, never commit a `.env`.
- **Vercel**: env vars are set per-environment in the dashboard; a var added
  only to Production will be missing in Preview deploys and vice versa.
  Changing a var requires a redeploy to take effect.
- **`KV_REST_API_URL` trailing slash**: `lib/kv.js:10` builds URLs as
  `${KV_URL}${path}` where every path starts with `/` (e.g. `/get/<key>`). A
  trailing slash on the var yields double-slash URLs like
  `https://xxx.upstash.io//get/...`. Whether the server tolerates that is not
  something to bet on — paste the URL exactly as Upstash shows it, no trailing
  slash. Also note `KV_URL`/`KV_TOKEN` are captured at module import
  (`lib/kv.js:6-7`); a changed value needs a server restart.
- **The two Bunny keys**: `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` (embed URLs, sha256 **hex**) vs
  `BUNNY_CDN_TOKEN_KEY` (thumbnail/CDN URLs, sha256 **base64url**). Different
  keys, different dashboard locations, different encodings. Symptom split:
  thumbnails 403 but video plays → CDN key problem; video won't play but
  thumbnails fine → token key problem. Full signing math in
  bunny-stream-reference; the original incident is commit 65dc992.
- **`GATE_SECRET` failure is quieter than intended**: because `verifyGrant`
  swallows the throw, a deploy missing `GATE_SECRET` looks healthy — pages
  render, the email form shows — and only a matching-email request-link call
  500s. Don't rely on the watch page itself to reveal this misconfiguration.
- **Email failures happen after the record is stored** (`pages/api/share.js`:
  `createShareRecord` before `sendShareEmail`; same order in share-bulk): a
  send-time env problem still creates live `bunnyshare:*` records.
- **`SITE_URL` unset in dev** silently produces `https://localhost:3000` links
  in emails (https fallback is deliberate; set the var instead of touching the
  fallback).

## When NOT to use this skill

- Operating, deploying, or exercising an already-configured app (dev/prod
  workflow, cron cleanup, revocation, KV data conventions) →
  **bunny-sharing-run-and-operate**.
- Diagnosing a live failure from its symptom (403s, 500s, missing emails) →
  **bunny-sharing-debugging-playbook** (this skill only tells you what a
  *missing/wrong var* does; the playbook covers all causes).
- Bunny signing math and API details → **bunny-stream-reference**.
- Resend vs SMTP mechanics and deliverability → **email-delivery-reference**.

## Provenance and maintenance

All facts verified 2026-07-18 at commit 5905bba. Re-verify before trusting:

- Enumerate every env read (must match the catalog exactly):
  `grep -rhn "process\.env\.[A-Z_]*" lib pages middleware.js -o | sort -u`
- Documented vars: `grep -n "^[A-Z_]*=" .env.example` and the README table (`README.md:39-51`).
- Email path selection and from-chain: `grep -n "RESEND_API_KEY\|RESEND_FROM\|SMTP_" lib/mailer.js`
- SITE_URL fallback: `grep -n "SITE_URL" lib/shares.js pages/watch/\[token\].js`
- GATE_SECRET fail-loud + verifyGrant swallow: `sed -n '14,22p;47,66p' lib/gate.js`
- KV URL concatenation: `sed -n '6,17p' lib/kv.js`
- Ignore rules: `grep -n "env" .gitignore`
- Build-needs-no-env claim: `env -i PATH="$PATH" HOME="$HOME" npm run build` (expect success + middleware deprecation warning).
