# Email Delivery Reference (bunny-sharing)

Everything email in this app flows through **one function**: `deliver()` in
`lib/mailer.js`. There is no queue, no retry, no background worker — every send
is a synchronous `await` inside an API route handler. This skill is the domain
knowledge you need before touching that path, plus the minimum protocol theory
(Resend API, SMTP/STARTTLS, SPF/DKIM) that a zero-context session needs to
reason about it correctly.

All line numbers refer to the repo as of 2026-07-18 (branch
`claude/bulk-share-separate-links-auth-cblrle`, commit `5905bba`). Re-verify
with the commands in "Provenance and maintenance" before trusting them.

## 1. The deliver() routing contract

`lib/mailer.js:32-54`. Callers only ever build `{ to, subject, text, html }`;
`deliver()` decides HOW it is sent. The branch rule is a single check:

```
if RESEND_API_KEY is set  → Resend HTTP API  (resend SDK, resend.emails.send)
else                      → plain SMTP        (nodemailer.createTransport + sendMail)
```

Key facts, each verifiable in `lib/mailer.js`:

- **From address** (`fromAddress()`, lib/mailer.js:24-26):
  `RESEND_FROM || SMTP_FROM || SMTP_USER`. This fallback chain applies to BOTH
  branches — a Resend send with only SMTP_FROM set will use SMTP_FROM.
- **Resend errors** (lib/mailer.js:37-40): the SDK returns `{ error }` instead
  of throwing; `deliver()` converts it to a thrown
  `Error("Resend API error: <message>")`. So any error message starting with
  `Resend API error:` means the API branch ran — instantly tells you which
  branch a failure came from.
- **SMTP branch** (lib/mailer.js:44-53): fresh transporter per call,
  `port: Number(SMTP_PORT || 587)`, `secure: Number(SMTP_PORT) === 465`.
  No `verify()` call, no `requireTLS` — deliberately (see section 3).
- API route handlers (`pages/api/share.js:29-31`, `share-bulk.js`,
  `watch/request-link.js:60-62`) catch the thrown error and return
  `res.status(500).json({ error: err.message })`, so send failures surface as
  a 500 whose body contains the mailer message.
- **Ordering caveat**: in share/share-bulk the KV record is created BEFORE the
  email is sent (`pages/api/share.js:13-26`). A 500 from a send failure does
  NOT mean no share exists — the record is already stored.

### Which env vars are read in which branch

| Env var | Resend API branch | SMTP branch | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | selects the branch + auths the SDK | ignored (its absence IS this branch) | presence check only — an empty string counts as unset |
| `RESEND_FROM` | from address (1st choice) | from address (1st choice) | fallback chain is shared |
| `SMTP_FROM` | from address (2nd choice) | from address (2nd choice) | |
| `SMTP_USER` | from address (3rd choice) | from + auth user | |
| `SMTP_HOST` | ignored | transport host | |
| `SMTP_PORT` | ignored | port (default 587) + drives `secure` | |
| `SMTP_PASS` | ignored | auth pass | |

Corollary worth stating plainly: **when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set, every
SMTP_HOST/PORT/PASS value is dead config.** You cannot "also" use SMTP; the
API branch returns before the transporter is ever built. If someone reports
"I changed SMTP_HOST and nothing happened", check for a set `RESEND_API_KEY`
first.

### The three senders

All three are in `lib/mailer.js`; these are the only exports and the only
email the app ever sends.

| Sender | Called from | Trigger | Must contain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sendShareEmail({to, videoTitle, link, expiresAt})` (line 56) | `pages/api/share.js` | admin shares one video | the video title, the `/watch/<token>` link, the expiry date, "may be revoked" notice |
| `sendBulkShareEmail({to, items, expiresAt})` (line 78) | `pages/api/share-bulk.js` | admin bulk-shares N videos | one list item per video, each with its OWN distinct link (invariant: N videos = N tokens = N independently revocable links), shared expiry date |
| `sendMagicLinkEmail({to, videoTitle, link})` (line 108) | `pages/api/watch/request-link.js` | recipient types the matching email on `/watch/<token>` | the `/watch/<token>?grant=<signed>` magic link (15-min grant), "expires shortly" wording, "ignore if you didn't request this" |

Behavioral details you must preserve when editing:

- `sendShareEmail` and `sendMagicLinkEmail` throw `"Invalid link URL"` if
  `isValidUrl(link)` fails, BEFORE any send.
- `sendBulkShareEmail` silently **filters** invalid-URL items
  (lib/mailer.js:79) and only throws (`"No valid link URLs"`) if none survive.
  Filtering vs throwing is intentional — a partial bulk email still delivers
  the valid links.
- Every sender provides BOTH `text` and `html` parts. Keep it that way
  (section 6).

## 2. Resend essentials, as they apply here

Resend (resend.com) is the preferred provider (README "Requirements" section,
`.env.example:23-27`). What a zero-context session needs to know:

- **API key**: starts with `re_`. Created in the Resend dashboard. Goes in
  `RESEND_API_KEY`. Setting it flips `deliver()` into the API branch — that is
  the entire switch.
- **Domain verification is a hard requirement for the from address.** Resend
  only accepts a `from` on a domain you have verified (DNS records added via
  the Resend dashboard). An unverified from domain does not spam-folder — it
  fails the API call outright, and you'll see it as a thrown
  `Resend API error: ...` (typically a validation/403-style message naming the
  domain). `.env.example:24-25` and README both say `RESEND_FROM` must be "a
  verified sender on your Resend domain" — this is why.
- **Sandbox sender for testing ONLY**: Resend allows sending from
  `onboarding@resend.dev` without verifying any domain, but only to the email
  address of the Resend account owner. Useful for a first smoke test of the
  API branch when no domain is verified yet; never usable for real recipients.
  Label any config using it as testing-only and do not leave it in production
  env.
- **Resend-via-SMTP bridge** (the alternate way to use Resend): Resend also
  exposes an SMTP endpoint. Config:
  `SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com`, `SMTP_PORT=587`, `SMTP_USER=resend`,
  `SMTP_PASS=<the re_... API key>`. **Critically, per deliver()'s branch rule
  this only takes effect when `RESEND_API_KEY` is UNSET** — if you set both,
  the API branch wins and the bridge config is dead. There is no reason to
  prefer the bridge here except as a discriminating experiment (e.g. proving
  an API-branch failure is not credential-related). The native API branch is
  the documented preferred path (lib/mailer.js:28-31 comment).

## 3. SMTP minimum theory (ports, TLS, and this code)

Two ways an SMTP connection gets encrypted:

- **Port 587 = STARTTLS (submission)**: the client connects in **plaintext**,
  the server advertises `STARTTLS`, and the connection is upgraded to TLS
  before authentication. In nodemailer terms this is `secure: false` — "not
  secure" describes only the initial connect, not the final channel.
- **Port 465 = implicit TLS (smtps)**: the connection is TLS **from the first
  byte**. Nodemailer: `secure: true`.

The code encodes this convention in one line (lib/mailer.js:47):

```js
secure: Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT) === 465,
```

So `secure` is derived from the port, never set independently. What breaks
when port and provider expectation disagree:

| Misconfig | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Provider requires 465/implicit TLS, but `SMTP_PORT=587` | Client connects to port 587 with `secure:false`. If the provider doesn't listen on 587 → connection refused/timeout. If something answers 587 expecting implicit TLS, the plaintext SMTP greeting exchange fails → garbled-greeting / handshake error. Symptom class: connection-level errors before auth. |
| Provider requires 587/STARTTLS, but `SMTP_PORT=465` | Client opens a TLS handshake (`secure:true`) against a port serving plaintext-then-STARTTLS (or nothing). TLS handshake fails or hangs until timeout — typical errors: `ETIMEDOUT`, `ESOCKET`, `wrong version number`. Again fails before auth. |
| Correct port, wrong creds | Connection and TLS succeed, then auth fails — `EAUTH` / `535`. Different symptom class; use it to distinguish transport problems from credential problems. |

Also note `SMTP_PORT` defaults to 587 for the **port** number
(`SMTP_PORT || 587`, line 46) but the `secure` check reads the raw env var —
with `SMTP_PORT` unset, `Number(undefined) === 465` is false, so the default
is coherently "587 + STARTTLS".

**History note (do not regress):** commits 7490382/4d9189f/1a2e4db (2026-07-02)
added `requireTLS: true`, `tls: { rejectUnauthorized: true }`, env validation,
and a `transporter.verify()` call before every send, plus emoji console
logging. Commit **30ecd7f** (2026-07-03, "Fix") stripped all of it: the
per-send `verify()` added a full extra SMTP round-trip of latency and its
failures blocked sends, and the logging leaked recipient data to logs. The
current minimal transporter is the deliberate end state. **Do NOT reintroduce
per-send `verify()`** — if you need a connection check, that belongs in a
one-off diagnostic script (see bunny-sharing-diagnostics), not the send path.
Full story: bunny-sharing-failure-archaeology.

## 4. Deliverability primer (scoped to this app)

Definitions, once:

- **SPF**: a DNS TXT record on the from-domain listing which servers may send
  mail for it.
- **DKIM**: a cryptographic signature added by the sending provider, verified
  against a public key in the from-domain's DNS.
- Both live at the **provider/domain level**, not in this codebase. With
  Resend, you add the DNS records Resend's dashboard gives you when verifying
  the domain; Resend then signs outgoing mail. There is nothing to configure
  in this repo — if SPF/DKIM are wrong, the fix is in DNS + the Resend
  dashboard.

Distinguishing the three failure symptoms (theory behind the triage in
bunny-sharing-debugging-playbook — go there first for the actual sequence):

| Symptom | Where you see it | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unverified domain | Immediate `Resend API error: ...` thrown from `deliver()`; API route returns 500; NO email exists anywhere | Config problem. Verify the domain in the Resend dashboard or fix `RESEND_FROM`. |
| Spam-foldering | Send succeeds (200 from the API route), message exists but lands in Junk | Reputation/authentication problem: missing/weak DKIM alignment, new domain, spammy content. Check the message headers (`Authentication-Results`) in the received mail. |
| Hard bounce | Send call succeeds, then the provider generates a bounce (visible in the Resend dashboard logs; SMTP may return a 5xx at send time for immediate rejects) | Recipient problem: mailbox doesn't exist, or recipient server rejects. The app has no bounce webhook — the Resend dashboard is the only place bounces are visible. |

**Latency asymmetry — why the magic-link email is special:** when
`sendMagicLinkEmail` fires, the recipient is sitting on the `/watch/<token>`
page having just typed their email, actively waiting for their inbox to
refresh (`pages/api/watch/request-link.js`). Seconds matter, and the grant
inside the link expires in 15 minutes (`MAGIC_LINK_TTL_MS`,
request-link.js:8), so a greylisting delay of 10+ minutes can render the link
near-dead on arrival. Share and bulk-share emails have no one waiting — a
minutes-late delivery is invisible. Practical consequences: (a) judge any
provider/config change by magic-link latency, not share-email latency;
(b) never add latency to `deliver()` itself (this is exactly why the per-send
`verify()` was removed); (c) a "the sign-in link never comes" report can be
slow delivery, the 30-second per-token throttle (request-link.js:10,43-48),
or the anti-enumeration generic response hiding an email mismatch — all three
look identical to the recipient by design.

## 5. Security guards in the mail path

Incident **29fb9be** (2026-07-10): CodeQL flagged XSS in email HTML plus
host-header poisoning of generated links. The fix added two guards to
`lib/mailer.js` (and made `baseUrl()` in `lib/shares.js` fall back to https).
These are invariants — do not weaken:

- `escapeHtml()` (lib/mailer.js:4-13) — escapes `& < > " '`. Applied to EVERY
  interpolated string in every HTML part: titles, links, dates, list items.
- `isValidUrl()` (lib/mailer.js:15-22) — parses with `new URL()` and accepts
  only `http:`/`https:` protocols. Applied to every link before it is mailed
  (throw in single senders, filter in bulk — see section 1).

Why links get both guards: `isValidUrl` blocks `javascript:`-style protocols
and garbage; `escapeHtml` prevents a quote in the URL from breaking out of the
`href="..."` attribute.

### Checklist: adding or editing ANY email template

A new template is a change to a security-incident surface; run it through
bunny-sharing-change-control. Within the template itself, ALL of the
following, no exceptions:

1. Every dynamic string interpolated into the `html` part goes through
   `escapeHtml()` — including strings you "know" are safe (dates, counts).
   Video titles come from the Bunny API and recipient emails from admin input;
   treat both as untrusted.
2. Every URL placed in the email is checked with `isValidUrl()` first —
   throw (or filter, for list emails) on failure, before calling `deliver()`.
3. Build links from `baseUrl(req)` (`lib/shares.js`) — never from the raw Host
   header and never hardcoded.
4. Provide BOTH `text` and `html` parts (section 6). The `text` part uses the
   raw (unescaped) strings — it is not HTML; escaping there would corrupt it.
   Match the existing senders: escaped in `html`, raw in `text`.
5. Do not log recipient addresses or message contents (30ecd7f removed such
   logging deliberately).
6. Route the send through `deliver()` — never construct a transporter or
   Resend client anywhere else. One delivery path is the contract.
7. Do not add pre-send network calls (verify(), DNS checks) to the send path.

## 6. HTML email constraints

- Templates here are deliberately primitive: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`,
  `<ul>/<li>`, `<br/>`. No CSS, no images, no layout tables. Keep it that
  way — email client HTML support is archaic and inconsistent, and
  link-plus-sentence emails have nothing to gain from styling. (Observed
  convention, not user doctrine.)
- **Always provide both `text` and `html`.** All three senders do
  (lib/mailer.js:66-73, 96-103, 116-123). The multipart text alternative
  matters for deliverability scoring (html-only mail is a spam signal) and
  for text-mode clients. Preserve this in any new sender.
- The share-email subject interpolates `escapedTitle`
  (lib/mailer.js:68) even though subjects are plain text, so a title
  containing `&` renders as `&amp;` in the subject line. Cosmetic quirk, noted
  here so you don't "discover" it as a bug mid-task; changing it is a
  behavior change — go through change-control.

## When NOT to use this skill

- **"Email not arriving" / recipient reports no mail** → start with
  bunny-sharing-debugging-playbook (symptom→triage sequence). This skill is
  the theory BEHIND that playbook, not the playbook.
- **Sending a live test email / probing the configured provider** →
  bunny-sharing-diagnostics (executable email probe script).
- **Full env-var catalog and from-scratch setup** →
  bunny-sharing-env-and-setup. This skill covers only the email vars' branch
  semantics.
- **Proving the email gate end-to-end in production** →
  bunny-sharing-email-gate-campaign.
- **What the magic-link grant contains / how it verifies** → that is
  `lib/gate.js` territory: bunny-sharing-architecture-contract.

## Provenance and maintenance

Verified 2026-07-18 against commit `5905bba` on branch
`claude/bulk-share-separate-links-auth-cblrle`. Re-verify before relying on
volatile facts:

```bash
# Branch rule, from-chain, error wrapping, secure/port logic, three senders:
sed -n '24,54p' lib/mailer.js          # fromAddress + deliver()
grep -n "export async function" lib/mailer.js
# Call sites (should be exactly these three files):
grep -rn "sendShareEmail\|sendBulkShareEmail\|sendMagicLinkEmail" pages/
# Env var documentation still matches:
sed -n '23,35p' .env.example
# Magic-link TTL and throttle:
grep -n "MAGIC_LINK_TTL_MS\|THROTTLE_SECONDS" pages/api/watch/request-link.js
# History claims (hardening added then removed):
git show 30ecd7f -- lib/mailer.js | head -60
```

If `lib/mailer.js` gains a sender, a provider branch, or a queue/retry layer,
this skill's sections 1-3 must be rewritten, not patched. Resend product facts
(sandbox sender address, SMTP bridge host/port) are external and dated
2026-07-18 — confirm against resend.com docs if a send against them fails.
